It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on date 27 March 2020), this leads to a total of 24K+ Deaths across the globe, including 16K+ deaths alone in Europe.Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread. This NoteBook is an effort to analyze the cumulative data of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time. In this notebook, the main focus is to analyze the spread trend of this virus all over the india.

### History of COVID-19 in India
On January 30, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala, which rose to three cases by February 3; all were students who had returned from Wuhan, China.No significant rise in cases was seen in the rest of February.

On 22 March 2020, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi.The government followed it up with lockdowns in 75 districts where COVID cases had occurred as well as all major cities.Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India.

The transmission escalated during March, after several cases were reported all over the country, most of which were linked to people with a travel history to affected countries. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia became the first victim of the virus in the country.On 4 March, 22 new cases came to light, including those of an Italian tourist group with 14 infected members.But number of cases start increasing dramtically after 19th March, but in the month of April it has been its peak.

Experts suggest the number of infections could be much higher as India's testing rates are among the lowest in the world.The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries.
